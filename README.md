Daemon to watch a directory using inotify, generating alerts when changes happen that were not authorized

Presently, this is pretty tied to my specific setup (a directory which is
exported from SVN which can't be changed by anything but an SVN commit).  One
day, the spirit of Open Source will surely prompt someone else to make it more
flexible.  One day...  Or maybe I'll do it myself.
